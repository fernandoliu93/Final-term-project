7)	Any Additional Feedback / Notes. 
This project was a huge challenge for me, although I spent a lot of time on this project but I never finished it. However, I have learned a lot through this project, for example, the skills and ideas that a software engineer needs to master. Obviously I am not very qualified now, but through this project I have the direction of my own efforts. I want to thank the professor and TA for their help, this will be my new starting point.
